# C_lang Learning Repository

Welcome to my C_lang repository! This space is dedicated to my journey learning the C programming language. Here you'll find various programs, ranging from simple exercises to more complex projects, all aimed at bolstering my understanding of C.

## What's Inside

- `basics/` - Fundamental concepts and starter code.
- `challenges/` - Problem-solving exercises to test my knowledge.
- `projects/` - Mini-projects and applications built with C.

## Getting Started

If you're new to C, consider checking out the `basics/` directory to get up to speed with the syntax and basic structures.

## Running the Code

To run the C programs:
1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed (like `gcc`).
2. Compile the code using `gcc filename.c -o filename`.
3. Execute the program with `./filename`.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repo and use the code as you wish. If you have suggestions or corrections, pull requests are welcome!

## Contact

If you have any questions or want to get in touch, please open an issue in the repository.

Happy coding!
